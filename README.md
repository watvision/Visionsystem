# WatVision Vision System

Any files related to taking the input of an image of a menu, and translating that to the position, text, and element type of any interactable element in that image.

## Installation notes:

You might be missing app/build/intermediates/ndk/debug/Android.mk. 

It's a built thing that's specific to each computer, so it's not going to be present on your computer or in this github repository. If you get a build error asking for that file get Craig Loewen to send it to you, or find a way to generate the ndk-build.
